STAC
====
Statistical Tests for Algorithms Comparison (STAC) is a new platform for statistical analysis to verify the results obtained from computational intelligence algorithms.
STAC consists of three different layers for performing statistical tests: a Python library, a set of web services and a web client.
Through this platform you can verify the results obtained from the learning algorithms applying the statistic tests to the experiments, which, among other uses, support the decision making process (the election of the most suitable algorithm, for example).
