				<p><b>Hypothesis testing:</b> Statistical problem which, in regard to a data sample, assumes an initial hypothesis, \({H_0}\), and an alternative hypothesis, \({H_1}\), and attempts to validate the truth of those hypothesis with statistical estimations. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p>
				<p><b>p-value:</b> Probability of obtaining a value at least as extreme as the obtained test statistic. The value of the statistic follows a particular sampling distribution (normal, chi-squared, etc.) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p>
				<p><b>Adjusted p-values:</b> p-values that depend on not just one but the whole family of comparisons. They are the result of POST-HOC tests (which apply if a ranking test finds any discrepancy).</p>
				<p><b>Statistic:</b> Quantitative measure calculated with the tests. This quantitative measure provides the feasibility of the null hypothesis. Each test has its characteristic way of obtaining this value and the statistics follow a particular probability distribution (such as normal distribution, etc.). The statistic is obtained from the data sample (uploaded file).</p>
				<p><b>Ranking:</b> In the ranking tests, the ranking provides the position of the algorithm when compared to the others (i.e. which is better?), ordered from greater to less or vice versa depending on whether the goal of the algorithms is to maximize or to minimize. </p>
				<p><b>Sum of positive / negative ranks:</b> In the Wilcoxon test, the sum of positive ranks denotes the sum of the ranks with discrepancies greater than 0 and the sum of negative ranks is the sum of the ranks with discrepancies less than 0. </p>
				<p><b>Critical point:</b> In the Wilcoxon test, when the amount of data sets without ties (discrepancies of 0) is less than or equal to 25, the final result is determined by the comparison of the statistic and the critical point from the Wilcoxon table (which is different for each significance level and amount of data sets without ties). </p>
				<p><b>Significance level (\({\alpha}\)):</b> Probability of rejecting a valid null hypothesis. Also known as confidence level or type 1 error. This level divides the distribution in two regions: the region of acceptance and the region of rejection.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p>
				<p><b>Rejection of \(H_0\):</sub></b> When the p-value is less than the significance level \({\alpha}\), the test is considered statistically significant and the null hypothesis is, therefore, rejected. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing" target="_blank">Learn more.</a></p>

				<p><b>Shapiro-Wilk:</b> Tests the null hypothesis that the samples come from a normally distributed population. This is considered as one of the most powerful tests, especially for samples of less than 30 elements.</p>
				<p><b>D'Agostino-Pearson:</b> Tests the null hypothesis that the samples come from normally distributed population. The test combines the asymmetry coefficient (to what extent the normal is symmetric or of coefficient 0) and the coefficient of Kurtosis (degree of amplitude, usually of coefficient 0) in order to obtain an statistic and p-value. It's less powerful than Shapiro-Wilk.</p>
				<p><b>Kolmogorov-Smirnov:</b> Performs a test of goodness of fit, to determine if the data follows a normal distribution.

The statistic of the ANOVA test, is estimated by the f-distribution, and the null hypothesis is rejected if: \(p-value &lt; {\alpha}\) (significance level or \({\alpha}\)), accepting the alternative hypothesis: at least one of the mean populations differs from the others.</p>

				<p>The <b>nonparametric ranking tests</b>, attempt to verify the null hypothesis that all the algorithms behave similarly, in which case their rankings should also be similar and, therefore, all the algorithms could be considered equal. The ranking tests differ in the method for calculating the rankings or in the way in which the statistic is calculated.</p>
				<p>These tests prove the existence or nonexistence of significant discrepancies between the algorithms to which the tests are applied. That is, the tests determine whether or not the hypothesis testing is statistically significant. If the null hypothesis that âall the algorithms are equalâ is rejected, we will know that there are some differences between the algorithms. It could happen, however, that a given algorithm performs similarly to other or others and, therefore, could be considered equal.</p>
				<p>That is why, the <b>POST-HOC tests</b> are applied after the ranking tests. These tests compare the algorithms and contrast the hypothesis to find discrepancies. Two types of comparison can be distinguished:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Control method: The first algorithm returned from the ranking test is compared with the others. There are \({K-1}\) comparisons.</li>
					<li>Multiple comparison (multitest): Compares all the algorithms between themselves. The number of comparisons would be \(m = {K*(K-1) \over 2}\).</li>

				<p><strong>Bonferroni-Dunn: </strong>This test rejects the null hypothesis if: \(p-value &lt; {\alpha \over (K-1)}\), where \({K}\) is the number of algorithms in the sample. It is a very conservative test and many differences can not be detected (the worst power).</p>
				<p><strong>Holm: </strong>It compares each \({p_i}\) (starting from the most significant or the lowest) with: \({\alpha \over (K-i)}\), where \({i \in [1,K-1]}\). If the hypothesis is rejected the test continues the comparisons. When an hypothesis is accepted, all the other hypothesis are accepted as well. It is better (more power) than Bonferroni-Dunn test, because it controls the FWER (familywise error rate), which is the probability of committing one or more type I errors among all hypothesis.</p>
				<p><strong>Hochberg: </strong>It compares in the opposite direction to Holm. As soon as an acceptable hypothesis is found, all the other hypothesis are accepted. It is better (more power) than Holm test, but the differences between them are small in practice.</p>
				<p><strong>Finner: </strong>Finner's test is similar to Holm's but each p-value associated with the hypothesis \({H_i}\) is compared with: \(p_i \leq {1-(1-\alpha)^{\frac{(K-1)}{i}}}\), where \({i \in [1,K-1]}\). It is more powerful than Bonferroni-Dunn, Holm, Hochberg and Li (only in some cases).</p>
				<p><strong>Li: </strong>This test rejects all the hypothesis if the least significant p-value is less than \({\alpha}\) (significance level). Else, the test accepts the hypothesis and rejects any remaining hypothesis whose p-value is less than: \(value = \frac{(1-p-value_{K-1})}{(1-\alpha)\alpha}\). The author states that the power of this test is Highly influenced by the p-value (greater power when the p-value is less than 0.5).</p>
				<p><strong>Multitests: </strong>Just like the others but with \({m}\) comparisons instead of \({K-1}\), where \(m = {K*(K-1) \over 2}\).</p>
				<p><strong>Shaffer: </strong>This test is like Holm's but each p-value associated with the hypothesis \({H_i}\) is compared as \(p_i \leq {\alpha \over t_i}\), where \({t_i}\) is the maximum number of possible hypothesis assuming that the previous \({(j-1)}\) hypothesis have been rejected.</p>

				<p>Through this web platform you can verify the results obtained from the learning algorithms applying the statistic tests to the experiments, which, among other uses, support the decision making process (the election of the most suitable algorithm, for example). At present, this is the most widely accepted method for validating this kind of experiments.</p>
				<p>The tests are based in the verification of hypothesis. For example: a test could verify the null hypothesis or \({H_0}\) that all the averages of the data obtained from an algorithm are equal. These tests, verify whether or not this initial hypothesis is valid. For that, an statistic is obtained (subject to a particular statistic distribution), and the probability of obtaining another statistic at least as extreme as the former (p-value). If this p-value is less than a given (\({\alpha}\) value), the null hypothesis will be rejected, otherwise accepted.</p>

				<p>The image shows the two regions in which a probability distribution function is divided (in this example the chi-squared distribution) after setting a significance level (\({\alpha}\) value): the acceptance region and the rejection region. The p-value, determines to which of these regions the statistic belongs to. The critical point (in this example, 1 point), is the value separating the two regions.</p>
